Our project focused on creating a blockchain-powered blood donation platform designed to promote secure and transparent transactions. By utilizing smart contracts and cryptocurrency, we incentivized donors with token-based rewards and integrated Ethereum-based fundraising mechanisms. The goal of our project is to increase the percentage of blood donors in India, making it easier to connect those in need with generous donors while leveraging blockchain for transparency and trust.
